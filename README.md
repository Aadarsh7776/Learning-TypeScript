# Learning TypeScript

This repository is dedicated to practicing TypeScript fundamentals.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains all source TypeScript (`.ts`) files.
    
- **`dist/`**: Contains the compiled JavaScript (`.js`) files generated by the TypeScript compiler.
    
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Configuration file for the TypeScript compiler (defines how code is transpiled).

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then install TypeScript globally or as a dev dependency:

Bash

```
npm install -g typescript
```

### 2. Configuration

The `tsconfig.json` is set up to watch the `src` folder and output to `dist`. Ensure your `tsconfig.json` contains these key settings:

JSON

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "CommonJS"
  }
}
```

## Executing TypeScript

Since browsers and Node.js cannot run TypeScript directly, you have two main ways to execute your code:

### Method A: Compile and Run (Standard)

This is the most common workflow. You compile the TS files into JS, then run the result with Node.

1. **Compile the code:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    tsc
    ```
    
    _(This reads your `tsconfig.json` and places the compiled files in `/dist`)_.
    
2. **Run the generated JavaScript:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    node dist/index.js
    ```
    

### Method B: Using `ts-node` (Development Only)

If you want to run your files instantly without manually checking the `/dist` folder, you can use `ts-node`.

1. **Install ts-node:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    npm install -g ts-node
    ```
    
2. **Execute directly:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    ts-node src/index.ts
    ```
    

### Method C: Watch Mode

To have TypeScript re-compile automatically every time you save a file:

Bash

```
tsc --watch
```
